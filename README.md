Learning Journey is a learning tracking application created by Swift, applying the MVVM methodolgy.

The interfaces for this app were provided to us through Sketch, and our task was to create an app using these interfaces.

# The application includes:

- initially, the app prompts the user to specify their goal and choose a timeframe.

- After that, the primary functionality interface will display a weekly calendar along with a streak for both recorded and continuous days.

- on this page, you can choose to record the day as learned or to pause the day.

- you will be allowed a maximum of 2 freeze days weekly, 8 monthly, and 96 yearly.

- then each day, you can utilize the app to update your status for the day, whether Learned / Freezed, or review the statuses from previous days.

- the streak must be refreshed within 32 hours, or else it will be lost.
